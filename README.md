## RSVPMe

RSVPMe will (supposedly) help you get people registered for events. It does not
attempt to be a full scheduling system, it just lets you create events and have people
register.

## Planned Features

These are things that are planned to happen at some point. There is no 'offical'
schedule at the moment.

* Multiple Registration Types - Each event can have multiple. Each can have it's own start/end date, fee, and code.
* Public/Private events.

## Installation

Build it and install from _build. If you do not know how... then I'd recommend
waiting for it to show up in the MODx Revolution Package Manager. (It is not there
now as this is still not really ready to be used!)
